# Norwegian (Bokmål) Keymaps Without Dead Keys
This repository contains Norwegian (Bokmål) keyboard layouts modified to remove dead keys.

## What are dead keys?
Dead keys are keys like ^, ~, or ´ that require pressing space after to get the symbol to appear.

## Why?
Dead keys are annoying, and only some Linux distros come with Norwegian (Bokmål) no-dead-keys as an option.

## Installation

### Mac
  Move `no-dead-keys.bundle` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` and reboot.

### Windows
  Run `setup.exe` the and follow the wizard instructions.
